## Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages now uses GitHub Actions to execute the **Jekyll** build. When using a branch as the source of your build, GitHub Actions must be enabled in your repository if you want to use the built-in Jekyll workflow. Alternatively, if GitHub Actions is unavailable or disabled, adding a **.nojekyll file** to the root of your source branch will bypass the Jekyll build process and deploy the content directly. For more information on enabling GitHub Actions, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository)."

### About custom workflows

**Custom workflows allow GitHub Pages sites to be built via the use of GitHub Actions.** You can still select the branch you would like to use via the workflow file, but you are able to do much more with the use of custom workflows. To start using custom workflows you must first enable them for your current repository. For more information, see "[Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)."
