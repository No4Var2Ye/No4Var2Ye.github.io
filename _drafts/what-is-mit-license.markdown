What is the MIT License?</br>
The MIT license gives express permission for users to reuse code for any purpose, sometimes even if code is part of proprietary software. As long as users include the original copy of the MIT license in their distribution, they can make changes or modifications to the code to suit their own needs.

It is one of the simplest open source license agreements. The intent was for the text to be understandable by average users and to avoid extensive litigation, which may arise from other similar Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licenses.
